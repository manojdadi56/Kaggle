## Tabs on nemotron.huikang.dev

- **[Base](https://nemotron.huikang.dev/base.html)** — Grid of competition problems colored by how the **base model** (pre-fine-tuning) does on each: solved / partially solved / unsolved across its generation runs. Click a problem for its prompt, parsed transformation table, answer, per-run extracted answer, and the token-level generation trace colored by logprob.
- **[Synthetic](https://nemotron.huikang.dev/synthetic.html)** — Same problem set as Base, but colored by investigation status (rule found / hypothesis formed / rule unknown). Click a problem for its prompt, parsed transformation, answer, submission, reasoning text, and investigation notes.
- **[Corpus](https://nemotron.huikang.dev/corpus.html)** — Sortable table of training corpus entries with masked, unmasked, and total token counts per row. Filter by category or problem ID; open a row to see the token-level trace with masking highlighted.
- **[Training](https://nemotron.huikang.dev/training.html)** — Per-problem table of step, loss-token count, and minimum logprob across training epochs. Select an epoch and a row to see token-level logprob changes against the base model.
- **[Metrics](https://nemotron.huikang.dev/metrics.html)** — Index of training runs (LR, backend, epochs, batch, LoRA rank, examples, tokens, steps). Click a run to see its per-step charts: loss per token (overall and by category), min logprob by category, gradient norm, learning rate, and step time. Cmd+click a legend entry to isolate that category.
